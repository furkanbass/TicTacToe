# TicTacToe
Each turn it asks either player 1 or player 2 to enter a row and col index which is where they want to place their x and o, and then the board is printed again with the x or o in the right spot.
If the position the player entered is “off the board” or already has an x or o on it, then the program notifies the player, who is prompted to enter another row and col.
Once the player wins by getting 3 in a row, column, or diagonal, the program prints that player 1 or 2 has won and prints out the final board.
